# MovieInventory-App
**CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS**

A project that can keep inventory of a home movie collection.

 - JavaFX GUI
 - Add/remove movies to/from list (Movies only added by IMDB id at the moment)
 - TMDB API - When a movie is selected from list, it displays the movie's title, release date, tagline, art, and TMDB id
